when calculating an average ratio the value found was 0.33and time was 1.01
the words used were : a maintain to why like my me testing two align
when using longer words the horspool algorithm seems to have way less shifts but with shorter word the shifts are approximately the same
for time there was no disernamble result that can be concluded. Maybe with different numbers it could be but the ratio was 1:1 for me
